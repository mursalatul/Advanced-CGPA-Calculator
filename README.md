# Advanced-CGPA-Calculator
<p>Advanced CGPA calculator is a simple solution of calculating CGPA. We called it an advanced CGPA calculator because it can calculate multiple CGPAs at a time and show the average CGPA. An administrator or teacher can see previous results, calculate new CGPA and update them to the database so that students can see them from their account. As a student he can check his previous average grade point, average grade letter of a particular semester. This project is based on Dhaka International University’s grading system. In a specific semester, there are not more than 6 courses in a semester. So the calculator also can calculate 6 course’s CGPA at a time.</p>
